# CarDekho_car_price_prediction
I got this dataset containing information about used cars listed on [cardekho](www.cardekho.com) from [Kaggle](https://lnkd.in/gjtYX8a)

The columns in the given dataset are as follows:
1. name of the car
2. year it was bought
3. Number of Owners
4. km_driven
5. fuel type
6. seller_type
7. transmission_type
8. selling_price

Here the goal was to predict selling_price of any used car, provided above information. In this model, I went with XG_Boost regression with Randomized Search CV to enhance my prediction accuracy.
